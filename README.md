# morse-encrypt-decrypt
very simple morse encrypter and decrypter. it was for an school project.
it's made in python.
what can it do:
- decrypt morse code to text (make sure to have space's between)
- encrypt text to morse code

Some extra functions i may or may not going to add-in:
- save the decrypted/encrypted as an txt document
- open the an txt document so that you won't have to type it again.
- more kind of encryptions
This all depends on how much time i have left after school.

be aware that i'm dutch, and thus the comments are maded in the dutch language.
